# Titanic-Survival-Analysis
Predicts Titanic survival using machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, and KNN, based on features like age, gender, and passenger class. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualization techniques to enhance predictive accuracy.
# Titanic Survival Analysis

A data science project that explores the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using machine learning techniques. The project applies various models, including Random Forest, SVM, and KNN, to analyze patterns and determine the key factors influencing survival rates. Visualizations and performance metrics are used to present insights.

## Project Overview

The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers, such as age, sex, class, and whether they survived or not. This project aims to build a model that can predict survival based on these features. The analysis utilizes various machine learning models and evaluates them for the best performance.
